Scaled the deployment of TimescaleDB on AWS instances from 8GB to 500 GB in order to capture a large data set of benchmark results. Discovered that certain packages necessary to easily deploy TimescaleDB were not readily available on Ubuntu for ARM. Successfully built these missing packages for ARM by modifying their respective source packages downloaded from Launchpad PPA. Summarized the results for TimescaleDB benchmarks on Intel, AMD, and ARM architectures and recorded them on JIRA (Project Management tool), SOAR (Solutions Assessment Request), and Sharepoint. Gained exposure and valuable insights into Linux architectures, Debian packaging and build system, and cloud computing infrastructure."

He was always positive and upbeat, adding energy to our team meetings. I could always count on him to complete his work on time, check in regularly, and be proactive about asking how else he could help. He worked well with others and was always friendly and considerate of his teammates. His ability to quickly learn new APIs and coding frameworks demonstrates his intelligence and technical skills. My only complaint is that he couldnâ€™t have worked with us longer! Andrew will make a valuable addition to your team and I highly recommend him.",
